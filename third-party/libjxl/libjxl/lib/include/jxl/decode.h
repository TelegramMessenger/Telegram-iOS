 *  - The JPEG XL image has an attached ICC Profile, in that case, the encoded
 *    structured data is not available, this function will return an error
 *    status. @ref JxlDecoderGetColorAsICCProfile should be called instead.
 *  - The JPEG XL image has an encoded structured color profile, and it

 *    You can still use @ref JxlDecoderGetColorAsICCProfile as well as an

 *    represented, the ICC profile may be a close approximation. It is also not
 *    always feasible to deduce from an ICC profile which named color space it
 *    exactly represents, if any, as it can represent any arbitrary space.
 *    HDR color spaces such as those using PQ and HLG are also potentially
 *    problematic, in that: while ICC profiles can encode a transfer function
 *    that happens to approximate those of PQ and HLG (HLG for only one given
 *    system gamma at a time, and necessitating a 3D LUT if gamma is to be
 *    different from 1), they cannot (before ICCv4.4) semantically signal that
 *    this is the color space that they represent. Therefore, they will
 *    typically not actually be interpreted as representing an HDR color space.
 *    This is especially detrimental to PQ which will then be interpreted as if
 *    the maximum signal value represented SDR white instead of 10000 cd/m^2,
 *    meaning that the image will be displayed two orders of magnitude (5-7 EV)
 *    too dim.
 *  - The JPEG XL image has an encoded structured color profile, and it

 * "brob" box, this will return "brob" if the decompressed argument is
 * JXL_FALSE, or the underlying box type if the decompressed argument is
 * JXL_TRUE.
 *
 * The following box types are currently described in ISO/IEC 18181-2:
 *  - "Exif": a box with EXIF metadata.  Starts with a 4-byte tiff header offset
 *    (big-endian uint32) that indicates the start of the actual EXIF data
 *    (which starts with a tiff header). Usually the offset will be zero and the
 *    EXIF data starts immediately after the offset field. The Exif orientation
 *    should be ignored by applications; the JPEG XL codestream orientation
 *    takes precedence and libjxl will by default apply the correct orientation
 *    automatically (see @ref JxlDecoderSetKeepOrientation).
 *  - "xml ": a box with XML data, in particular XMP metadata.
 *  - "jumb": a JUMBF superbox (JPEG Universal Metadata Box Format, ISO/IEC
 *    19566-5).
 *  - "JXL ": mandatory signature box, must come first, 12 bytes long including
 *    the box header
 *  - "ftyp": a second mandatory signature box, must come second, 20 bytes long
 *    including the box header
 *  - "jxll": a JXL level box. This indicates if the codestream is level 5 or
 *    level 10 compatible. If not present, it is level 5. Level 10 allows more
 *    features such as very high image resolution and bit-depths above 16 bits
 *    per channel. Added automatically by the encoder when
 *    JxlEncoderSetCodestreamLevel is used
 *  - "jxlc": a box with the image codestream, in case the codestream is not
 *    split across multiple boxes. The codestream contains the JPEG XL image
 *    itself, including the basic info such as image dimensions, ICC color
 *    profile, and all the pixel data of all the image frames.
 *  - "jxlp": a codestream box in case it is split across multiple boxes.
 *    The contents are the same as in case of a jxlc box, when concatenated.
 *  - "brob": a Brotli-compressed box, which otherwise represents an existing
 *    type of box such as Exif or "xml ". When @ref JxlDecoderSetDecompressBoxes
 *    is set to JXL_TRUE, these boxes will be transparently decompressed by the
 *    decoder.
 *  - "jxli": frame index box, can list the keyframes in case of a JPEG XL
 *    animation allowing the decoder to jump to individual frames more
 *    efficiently.
 *  - "jbrd": JPEG reconstruction box, contains the information required to
 *    byte-for-byte losslessly recontruct a JPEG-1 image. The JPEG DCT
 *    coefficients (pixel content) themselves as well as the ICC profile are
 *    encoded in the JXL codestream (jxlc or jxlp) itself. EXIF, XMP and JUMBF
 *    metadata is encoded in the corresponding boxes. The jbrd box itself
 *    contains information such as the remaining app markers of the JPEG-1 file
 *    and everything else required to fit the information together into the
 *    exact original JPEG file.
 *
 * Other application-specific boxes can exist. Their typename should not begin
 * with "jxl" or "JXL" or conflict with other existing typenames.
 *
 * The signature, jxl* and jbrd boxes are processed by the decoder and would
 * typically be ignored by applications. The typical way to use this function is
 * to check if an encountered box contains metadata that the application is
 * interested in (e.g. EXIF or XMP metadata), in order to conditionally set a
 * box buffer.
 *
 * @param dec decoder object
 * @param type buffer to copy the type into
 * @param decompressed which box type to get: JXL_FALSE to get the raw box type,

 * @return @ref JXL_DEC_SUCCESS if the value is available, @ref JXL_DEC_ERROR if
 *     not, for example the JXL file does not use the container format.
