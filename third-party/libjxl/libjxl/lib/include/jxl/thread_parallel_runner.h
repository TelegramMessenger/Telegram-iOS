 * @brief implementation using std::thread of a ::JxlParallelRunner.
 */

/** Implementation of JxlParallelRunner than can be used to enable
 * multithreading when using the JPEG XL library. This uses std::thread
 * internally and related synchronization functions. The number of threads
 * created is fixed at construction time and the threads are re-used for every
 * ThreadParallelRunner::Runner call. Only one concurrent
 * JxlThreadParallelRunner call per instance is allowed at a time.
 *
 * This is a scalable, lower-overhead thread pool runner, especially suitable
 * for data-parallel computations in the fork-join model, where clients need to
 * know when all tasks have completed.
 *
 * This thread pool can efficiently load-balance millions of tasks using an
 * atomic counter, thus avoiding per-task virtual or system calls. With 48
 * hyperthreads and 1M tasks that add to an atomic counter, overall runtime is
 * 10-20x higher when using std::async, and ~200x for a queue-based thread
