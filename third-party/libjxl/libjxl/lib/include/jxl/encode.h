 * Note: the sample data type in pixel_format is allowed to be different from
 * what is described in the JxlBasicInfo. The type in pixel_format, together
 * with an optional @ref JxlBitDepth parameter set by @ref
 * JxlEncoderSetFrameBitDepth describes the format of the uncompressed pixel
 * buffer. The bits_per_sample and exponent_bits_per_sample in the JxlBasicInfo
 * describes what will actually be encoded in the JPEG XL codestream.
 * For example, to encode a 12-bit image, you would set bits_per_sample to 12,
 * while the input frame buffer can be in the following formats:
 *  - if pixel format is in JXL_TYPE_UINT16 with default bit depth setting
 *    (i.e. JXL_BIT_DEPTH_FROM_PIXEL_FORMAT), input sample values are rescaled
 *    to 16-bit, i.e. multiplied by 65535/4095;
 *  - if pixel format is in JXL_TYPE_UINT16 with JXL_BIT_DEPTH_FROM_CODESTREAM
 *    bit depth setting, input sample values are provided unscaled;
 *  - if pixel format is in JXL_TYPE_FLOAT, input sample values are rescaled
 *    to 0..1, i.e.  multiplied by 1.f/4095.f.
 * While it is allowed, it is obviously not recommended to use a pixel_format
 * with lower precision than what is specified in the JxlBasicInfo.
 *
 * We support interleaved channels as described by the JxlPixelFormat:
 * - single-channel data, e.g. grayscale
 * - single-channel + alpha
 * - trichromatic, e.g. RGB
 * - trichromatic + alpha
 *
 * Extra channels not handled here need to be set by @ref
 * JxlEncoderSetExtraChannelBuffer.
 * If the image has alpha, and alpha is not passed here, it will implicitly be
 * set to all-opaque (an alpha value of 1.0 everywhere).
 *
 * The pixels are assumed to be encoded in the original profile that is set with
 * JxlEncoderSetColorEncoding or JxlEncoderSetICCProfile. If none of these
 * functions were used, the pixels are assumed to be nonlinear sRGB for integer
 * data types (JXL_TYPE_UINT8, JXL_TYPE_UINT16), and linear sRGB for floating
 * point data types (JXL_TYPE_FLOAT16, JXL_TYPE_FLOAT).
 *
 * Sample values in floating-point pixel formats are allowed to be outside the
 * nominal range, e.g. to represent out-of-sRGB-gamut colors in the
 * uses_original_profile=false case. They are however not allowed to be NaN or
 * +-infinity.

/** Adds a metadata box to the file format. JxlEncoderProcessOutput must be used
 * to effectively write the box to the output. @ref JxlEncoderUseBoxes must
 * be enabled before using this function.
 *
 * Boxes allow inserting application-specific data and metadata (Exif, XML/XMP,
 * JUMBF and user defined boxes).
 *
 * The box format follows ISO BMFF and shares features and box types with other
 * image and video formats, including the Exif, XML and JUMBF boxes. The box
 * format for JPEG XL is specified in ISO/IEC 18181-2.
 *
 * Boxes in general don't contain other boxes inside, except a JUMBF superbox.
 * Boxes follow each other sequentially and are byte-aligned. If the container
 * format is used, the JXL stream consists of concatenated boxes.
 * It is also possible to use a direct codestream without boxes, but in that
 * case metadata cannot be added.
 *
 * Each box generally has the following byte structure in the file:
 * - 4 bytes: box size including box header (Big endian. If set to 0, an
 *   8-byte 64-bit size follows instead).
 * - 4 bytes: type, e.g. "JXL " for the signature box, "jxlc" for a codestream
 *   box.
 * - N bytes: box contents.
 *
 * Only the box contents are provided to the contents argument of this function,
 * the encoder encodes the size header itself. Most boxes are written
 * automatically by the encoder as needed ("JXL ", "ftyp", "jxll", "jxlc",
 * "jxlp", "jxli", "jbrd"), and this function only needs to be called to add
 * optional metadata when encoding from pixels (using JxlEncoderAddImageFrame).
 * When recompressing JPEG files (using JxlEncoderAddJPEGFrame), if the input
 * JPEG contains EXIF, XMP or JUMBF metadata, the corresponding boxes are
 * already added automatically.
 *
 * Box types are given by 4 characters. The following boxes can be added with
 * this function:
 * - "Exif": a box with EXIF metadata, can be added by libjxl users, or is
 *   automatically added when needed for JPEG reconstruction. The contents of
 *   this box must be prepended by a 4-byte tiff header offset, which may
 *   be 4 zero bytes in case the tiff header follows immediately.
 *   The EXIF metadata must be in sync with what is encoded in the JPEG XL
 *   codestream, specifically the image orientation. While this is not
 *   recommended in practice, in case of conflicting metadata, the JPEG XL
 *   codestream takes precedence.
 * - "xml ": a box with XML data, in particular XMP metadata, can be added by
 *   libjxl users, or is automatically added when needed for JPEG reconstruction
 * - "jumb": a JUMBF superbox, which can contain boxes with different types of
 *   metadata inside. This box type can be added by the encoder transparently,
 *   and other libraries to create and handle JUMBF content exist.
 * - Application-specific boxes. Their typename should not begin with "jxl" or
 *   "JXL" or conflict with other existing typenames, and they should be
 *   registered with MP4RA (mp4ra.org).
 *
 * These boxes can be stored uncompressed or Brotli-compressed (using a "brob"
 * box), depending on the compress_box parameter.
 *
 * @param enc encoder object.
 * @param type the box type, e.g. "Exif" for EXIF metadata, "xml " for XMP or
